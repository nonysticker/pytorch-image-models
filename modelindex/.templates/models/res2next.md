# Summary

**Res2Net** is an image model that employs a variation on [ResNeXt](https://paperswithcode.com/method/resnext) bottleneck residual blocks. The motivation is to be able to represent features at multiple scales. This is achieved through a novel building block for CNNs that constructs hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. This represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer.

## How do I train this model?

You can follow the [timm recipe scripts](https://rwightman.github.io/pytorch-image-models/scripts/) for training a new model afresh.
